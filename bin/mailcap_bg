# Mutt mailcap helper -- this program copies the file to be viewed
# prior to starting the viewer in the background.  This allows mutt to
# delete the temporary file without disturbing the viewer.
#
# Syntax: mailcap_bg filename prog [args]
#         mailcap_test filename prog (determines if mailcap_bg can run)

# from the disk prior to deleting it.  Therefore we can't use a hard

# it.  We can't mv either, since if mutt is providing a file attached
# to a draft mail, it's not a temporary file.  Therefore copy is the
