#                  ** includes messages Cc: me
#  ~P              message is from you (consults $alternates)
#  ~t USER         message is to USER
#  ~c USER         message is Cc: USER
#  ~C USER         message is to: or Cc: USER

   # Mutt's default 
#  set default_hook="~f %s !~P | (~P ~C %s)"

   # My attempts.  The tricky bit is getting it right when it's
   # neither to or from you (e.g. list mail), but without adding too
   # loose a pattern so as to screw up friend's group mails.  The
   # first clause should handle group mails from friends, since ~p
   # includes messages Cc'd to me.  The 3rd clause is for list mail
   # which doesn't have me in From: or To:.
   # 
   # I suspect the main problem is that with default_hook set to
   # multiple clauses, internally, mutt's algorithm is effectively
   # "iterate through all save-hooks, setting %s and seeing if any
   # clauses match" whereas I'd want it to try '~p ~f %s' for all
   # hooks first as the outer loop, then '~P ~t %s' etc.  However by
   # making the clauses mutually exclusive regardless of the value of
   # %s, only one of the many clauses (generated from the many values
   # of %s) can ever match, so the order of clause matching ceases to
   # matter.
   
   #set default_hook="(~p ~f %s) | (~P ~t %s) | (!~p !~P ~C %s)"
   # This one's better when friends bcc me:
   set default_hook="(~p ~f %s) | (~P ~t %s) | (!~p !~P ~f %s)"

   # If I can't get the list stuff right, it's probably
   # worth adopting the
   #
   #   foo-hook "~f foo-list@lists\.foo\.com" =folder
   # 
   # form when matching lists; I think some lists have their address
   # in the To: line, and some in From:.  Sometimes people even
   # Cc: to a list, or send To: me *and* To: the list...
