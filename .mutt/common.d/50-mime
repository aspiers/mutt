# We could include text/calendar at the beginning of alternative_order.
# Impact:
#
#   - Invites from Groupwise are structured like this:
#
#       multipart/alternative
#         |-> text/plain
#         `-> text/calendar
#
#     so this would result in just the output from mutt-ics, which is
#     a bit more informative (but may risk dropping minor info only
#     visible via the text/plain).
#
#   - Invites from Google Calendar are structured like this:
#
#       multipart/alternative
#         |-> text/plain
#         |-> text/html
#         `-> text/calendar
#       application/ics
#
#     so this would result in a double-decker from mutt-ics, once from
#     the text/calendar and once from the application/ics.
#
# So it's probably better not to bother.
